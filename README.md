# 2024-s-Cloud-Outages-What-Went-Wrong-and-How-to-Avoid-the-Same-Pitfalls-in-2025
Cloud downtime is no longer a hypothetical risk—it’s a financial and operational reality. In 2024, major outages impacted businesses worldwide, from Microsoft Azure’s recurring disruptions to Salesforce’s global CRM downtime.

The costs? Staggering. IDC reports that unplanned cloud outages can cost organizations an average of $105,000 per hour, with some extending into the millions. Beyond financial losses, reputational damage and customer churn can haunt businesses for years.

Why are these outages happening? Common culprits include faulty updates, metadata store issues, and over-reliance on single providers. For example, Google Cloud’s metadata failure in February caused cascading delays for thousands of businesses. Similarly, a database upgrade gone wrong stalled Jira’s global operations in January. These incidents highlight how vulnerabilities in cloud ecosystems can bring entire organizations to a standstill.

But 2024 wasn’t all doom and gloom. The year also taught us invaluable lessons about what works in cloud resilience. Businesses that prioritized multi-cloud strategies avoided the most severe impacts by diversifying their cloud providers. AI-powered monitoring tools emerged as a critical line of defense, enabling real-time detection of issues before they escalated. Proactive maintenance and robust disaster recovery frameworks also proved essential for minimizing downtime and safeguarding critical operations.
